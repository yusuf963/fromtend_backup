Install the necessary packages using NPM and familarise yourself with the 
documentation for these packages named inside "package.json".

Your task is to create a web responsive application for users who are ready 
to retire to and would like choose how they wish to take their pension income. 
The "api.js" file has 3 mocked functions to help mimic real API calls. The 
"screenshots" folder has the design specification of what should be developed.

Screen 1: The user must login and can only access further screens if logged in.
          Submit the username/password to the "loginMock" API function to 
          recieve an authentication token.

Screen 2: The options can be to take a weekly, monthly or annual income of 
          their choosing and starting at any date within the next year. These 
          options will be needed for the next screen.

Screen 3: On load, submit the selected option to the "evaluationApiMock" 
          to recieve the data needed to display onto a chart. If the user 
          accepts the withdrawal, then submit the acceptance with the 
          "acceptWithdrawalMock" API function. (Hint: the chart uses the 
          devextreme package)

Screen 4: The final screen should give the option to logout from the application.
          Logging out should also remove any storage of the authenticated token 
          from the application.
