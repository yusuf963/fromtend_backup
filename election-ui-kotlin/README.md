BBC Android Technical Assessment
---

This is a mobile client for a mock elections system which could show results pages similar to how BBC News covers elections. 
**Note:** If you are not familiar with how elections work in the UK, please see this short BBC video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRxUhGetEPQ


## Setup

Requires:

- Android Studio Chipmunk or higher
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), for screensharing

Notes:

- In this directory there is a single Android project containing two separate application modules, `appWithComposeUI` and `appWithXmlUI`. **You must choose whether to use Jetpack Compose or XML layouts, and use the appropriate module to complete the assessment.**
- The project also includes an `api` module containing shared code used by both targets. As part of completing the tasks, you may make changes inside this module if you wish.
- All targets also include unit tests, which can be run by selecting the correct folder in the project hierarchy menu, right clicking and choosing _'Run Tests in...'_.

**Please verify that you can open the project in Android Studio, build the application, and run the unit tests in advance of your booked assessment time.**

We do not ask you to do anything more until your booked assessment time. If you do make any changes to the code before your assessment, please ensure you have reverted the code to its initial (HEAD) state before your assessment.

## Assessment Time

In the assessment we will ask you to screenshare your working environment and talk through the following with us:

- What does this system do? What are its key features?
- New Feature requests! - The election product team have some feature requests that we would like you to take a look at. They can be found in `Tasks.md`.

If you have any problems with any of the above, please get in touch via your recruitment contact.
