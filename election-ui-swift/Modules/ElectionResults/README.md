# ElectionResults

`ElectionResults` provides an API wrapper around the Elections back end, providing Candidate information and live results for ongoing elections. To get started, use the `ResultsServiceFactory` to create a `ResultsService` instance, which provides a few simple methods to retrieve results data.

This library is part of an assessment exercise, and all data returned by the `ElectionResults` package is locally-held mock data. Please feel free to inspect `JSONResultsRepository.swift` to see the data which will be returned.
