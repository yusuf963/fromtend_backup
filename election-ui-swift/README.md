BBC iOS Technical Assessment
---

This is a mobile client for a mock elections system which could show results pages similar to how BBC News covers elections. 
**Note:** If you are not familiar with how elections work in the UK, please see this short BBC video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRxUhGetEPQ


## Setup

Requires:

- macOS 11.3 (Big Sur) or higher 
- Xcode 13 or higher
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), for screensharing

Notes:

1. In this directory there is a single Xcode project containing two separate application targets, `AssessmentSwiftUI` and `AssessmentUIKit`. **You must choose whether to use UIKit or SwiftUI, and use the appropriate target to complete the assessment.**
2. The project also includes a Swift Package containing shared code used by both targets. As part of completing the tasks, you may make changes inside this package if you wish.
3. All targets also include unit tests, which can be run by selecting the correct target in the Xcode target selection menu and typing `Cmd-U`.

**Please verify that you can open the project in Xcode, build the application, and run the unit tests in advance of your booked assessment time.**

We do not ask you to do anything more until your booked assessment time. If you do make any changes to the code before your assessment, please ensure you have reverted the code to its initial (HEAD) state before your assessment.

## Assessment Time

In the assessment we will ask you to screenshare your working environment and talk through the following with us:

- What does this system do? What are its key features?
- New Feature requests! - The election product team have some feature requests that we would like you to take a look at. They can be found in `Tasks.md`.

If you have any problems with any of the above, please get in touch via your recruitment contact.
