The product owner has asked us to use to add some additional features to the application. They are unfortunately not available to clarify the below so we are being trusted in our interpretation of them!

Features:

1) There are no candidate names!

- I'd like to see the candidate names added to the UI. The candidate ID numbers are meaningless to the audience.

2) There is no way to tell when the counting has finished and a winner has been declared.

- Can we make it clear when the counting is complete?
- Can we calculate the winner and highlight them in the table somehow?
- When counting is complete can be remove the refresh button?

3) Why does the table vanish when I press "refresh"?

- Can it not do this? Obviously it still needs to update the data!
