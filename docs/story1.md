### Story #1

```
Given I have accessed the Dunelm website
When I visit the home page
Then I must be presented with a list of all products
```

- A list of products can be found in `packages/api/products.json`. This should be treated as the data source for the api.
- The user must be presented with the following properties for all products:
  - name
  - description
  - category
  - color
  - price
  - inStock

If you complete this please move on to [Story 2](./story2.md).
